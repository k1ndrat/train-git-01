Superhero Management System
Description
This project is a superhero management system that allows users to create, edit, remove, list, and view details of superheroes. Users can assign and remove images for each superhero, and the list of superheroes is paginated, displaying five items per page.

Assumptions
Please note that the following assumptions have been made during development:

Database Setup: It is assumed that you have already set up a database system (e.g., MongoDB) and have the necessary connection details ready.

Node.js and npm/yarn: Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

React Development Environment: Make sure you have a working React development environment set up.

React Router: This project assumes you are using React Router for navigation.

Running the Node.js Backend
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure the database connection by creating a .env file in the backend directory and adding your database connection URL. For example:

bash
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/superheroes
Start the Node.js server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The Node.js backend should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

Running the React.js Frontend
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The React.js frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Accessing the Application
You can access the superhero management system by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000. The application allows you to create, edit, remove, list, and view details of superheroes, as specified in the project requirements.

Additional Notes
Make sure that the Node.js backend is running before you start the React.js frontend.
The backend API endpoints are located at http://localhost:5000/api/superheroes.
Feel free to explore and use the application to manage superheroes.

Please replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your project repository. Make sure to update any other specific details according to your project's configuration and requirements.
